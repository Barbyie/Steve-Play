# Discord bot that allows you to do some pretty cool stuff.

- Sometime in 2022, music bots stopped working on Discord, making pretty much every server lifeless without music.
- Eventually, I decided to build my own, because why not ?
- So here is my Discord bot with some pretty cool messages when people join or leave, and that allows you to play audio from that famous website that starts with Y.


# How to use ?

- First, create a file called 'token.txt' and place it in the same folder as the main2.py.
- Place your token inside that text file and save.
- Make sure that you have nextcord and youtube_dl installed (You can use pip to install both).
- Now just run the main2.py and be happy :)
